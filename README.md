🖼️ Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography
🔍 Overview
This project implements image steganography to securely hide and retrieve text messages inside an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The hidden message is password-protected, ensuring only authorized users can extract it.

📌 Features
✅ Stealthy Encryption – Hides text inside an image without visible changes.
✅ Password Protection – Ensures only authorized users can extract the message.
✅ Minimal Distortion – The image quality remains almost unchanged.
✅ Supports Multiple Formats – Works with .png, .jpg, and other OpenCV-supported formats.
✅ Simple Command-line Interface – Easy to encrypt and decrypt messages.
